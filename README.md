# What is it?
Wire owl is a packet analyser for files generated by the space wire recorder
device created by STAR Dundee. It parses the packets into a manageable format
and decrypts them to find useful statistics such as error rate or the amount of
packets contained in one file. It also generates graphs to give the user a
visualization of the data and allows them to compare points on the graphs with
the relevant data.
